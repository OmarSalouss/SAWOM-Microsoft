I learned about the **Lifecycle of Team Microsoft at Asal Technology**, which followed the Agile Scrum methodology. I worked with a BE team and gained a lot of knowledge in improving my personal skills, learning new technologies and tools, applying MVC architecture with SOLID principles, and establishing new relationships.

Some of the personal skills I enhanced during this experience include teamwork, dividing work and tasks among teams, the ability to learn quickly, effective communication, and working well under pressure.

I had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and tools during my time with Team Microsoft at Asal Technology. These included: ExpressJs Framework, Microsoft Teams, Azure DevOps Server, Postman, Supabase, Swagger, Firebase and Cloudinary.

Each of these technologies and tools played a role in enhancing my skills and contributing to my professional growth.

We did a lot of commits on _Azure DevOp_s, but nothing shows these commits here. Unfortunately.
