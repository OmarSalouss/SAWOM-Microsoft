# SAWOM
SAWOM is a group of the first char of the names of my Team.
## Introduction:
We developed a website serving as a business incubator, where business owners are organized into specific groups based on their industry. For example, all clothing business owners are grouped together for easy navigation and so on. This setup allows clients to conveniently find exactly what they are looking for.

As an individual contribution, I created a [Chatting-System]([url](https://github.com/OmarSalouss/Chatting-System.git)) within the website. This system enables users to send and receive messages, and it includes an auto-reorder feature based on the previous chat history and message timestamps. Additionally, users have the ability to search for any specific user within the system.

Instead of developing a payment system, we opted to utilize the Chatting-System was I built. This system serves as a means for communication and interaction between users, but it does not have the functionality to process payments.
## Internship:
**Software Engineer â€“ Microsoft R & D
ASAL Technologies | Internship
Mar 2023 - May 2023 | Palestinian Authority | Remote**

I learned about the **Lifecycle of Team Microsoft at Asal Technology**, which followed the Agile Scrum methodology. I worked with a BE team and gained a lot of knowledge in improving my personal skills, learning new technologies and tools, applying MVC architecture with SOLID principles, and establishing new relationships.

Some of the personal skills I enhanced during this experience include teamwork, dividing work and tasks among teams, the ability to learn quickly, effective communication, and working well under pressure.

I had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and tools during my time with Team Microsoft at Asal Technology. These included: ExpressJs Framework, Microsoft Teams, Azure DevOps Server, Postman, Supabase, Swagger, Firebase and Cloudinary.

Each of these technologies and tools played a role in enhancing my skills and contributing to my professional growth.

We did a lot of commits on Azure DevOps, but nothing shows these commits here. Unfortunately.
